            Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm a 19 yo developer, designer and builder. I started my
            journey as a freelancer, doing projects for local and international
            small to medium sized business, but later on I moved my focus on
            working with early-stage startups. I help people with designing user
            interfaces, (sometimes even logos!), building their backend and
            sometimes building their frontend. The work varies from contract to
            contract.

          <Text>Right now I'm building prysm as a solo-dev.</Text>
          <Text>Learn more about prysm!</Text>
        </VStack>
      </Center>
    </>
  );
